## Joining GLOBUS groups ##
For most DERIVA deployments, access is generally controlled by GLOBUS groups.

1. Navigate to the GLOBUS group page(s) required for access.
   * The URL for these pages will be provided to you by an administrator, either directly or via an email invitation.

2. The app will ask you to login. Please login with one of the following IDs. This login will be used later to access the system.
   * University ID (e.g. USC ID)
   * Globus ID. Create a GlobusID [here](https://www.globusid.org/).
   * ORCID ID
   * Google ID

3. Click "Join this group" to initiate a request to us. You will get a notification once your request is approved.

## DERIVA Login ##
1. Navigate to the main page for the site.
2. On the navigation bar, click "Log in" to login.
3. Login to the system using the same ID that you used when joined the GLOBUS groups (above).
4. Once you are logged in, use the navigation bar to browse DERIVA catalog data.
